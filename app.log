Role - Machine Learning Engineer 2 

Job Description 
 Telus International AI Data Solutions or TI AI for short, has been a global leader in data services since 2005. Listed on Feb 21 on the NYSE, TI now has a market cap of $10Million+. With Playment’s acquisition on July 21, we now have a combined strength in the video, images, and audio text labelling, serving the world’s top ML teams.
We’ve built a truly industry-agnostic platform to support the growing needs of our customers. Eg of our customer use cases - Automotive companies build self-driving capabilities, Agriculture companies for identify weeds & fruit picking, Insurance companies for claim processing & damage detection, Retail companies for shelf tracking, Drone/Satellite imagery for terrain analysis, E-commerce for cataloguing & visual object understanding etc.
Why is it important? 
 High-quality training data is quintessential to improving the precision of ML algorithms. Forbes lists ‘Autonomous Cars’ as one of the technology trends for the next decade and also estimates ML engineers spent 70% of their time in pre/post-processing & data management steps.

Companies need to build sophisticated tooling (supporting all forms of sensor data) and hire and manage hundreds of skilled people to ensure high-quality labelled data. Our autonomous driving customers estimate 1 hour of video data needs 800 man-hours of manual human work. Today, in the wake of the autonomous car industry only a few million km of data has been labelled, and 10x more will be collected before the world sees them on the road. Just as DevOps is critical to tech implementation, AI Ops will be a big challenge as AI development commercialises in the next 5-10 years.

About Netskope

Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve.

Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, St. Louis, Bangalore, London, Melbourne, Taipei, and Tokyo. Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events (pre and hopefully post-Covid) and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive. Visit us at Netskope Careers. Please follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter@Netskope.

You can’t work hard. We are a self-funded company competing against billion-dollar VC-backed companies, and we work harder to succeed. If you can't commit to working 10-12 hours a day, six days a week, this may not be the right fit.
You lack attention to detail and quality. Our primary market is the US, and we pride ourselves on shipping high-quality software that works.
You are not product and customer-obsessed. If you only focus on the core technology without understanding the market and the customers’ needs, this role might not be suitable for you.

Looking For The Following Traits

Good to work with: Others enjoy collaborating with you because of your positive attitude and technical expertise.
Collaboration: You effectively work with engineers, product managers, and executives to clarify product requirements and maintain project visibility.
Varied Experience: You are comfortable working across a wide range of computational aspects, including distributed systems, networking, multiple programming languages, and large-scale systems.
Sprint Management: You can manage and drive sprints to deliver against the product roadmap.
Excellence: You are committed to striving for excellence in everything you do.
Customer Obsession: You prioritize customers’ needs and understand that the success of the product hinges on their success.
Hard Work: You are self-motivated, proactive, and dedicated, willing to work long hours as necessary.
Business and customer acumen: You understand the connection between the products we build and the revenue they generate, both directly and indirectly.

Responsibilities

Own Foundational Features: Lead and ship key features that directly impact customers, working independently and as part of the team to ensure reliable feature delivery.
Technical Leadership: Although this is not a managerial role, you will be the most experienced engineer, guiding the team, anticipating risks, and proactively solving challenges to ensure smooth product functionality.
Review and Debug Code: Participate in code reviews and help troubleshoot bugs. All engineers spend one day per week working on technical support to stay connected with customer challenges.
Improve Performance and Reliability: Continuously optimize legacy code to enhance system performance and reliability.

Requirements

At least 5 years of software engineering experience, ideally in an early-stage SaaS company.
Proven expertise in building and scaling complex systems for high-growth companies.
Strong proficiency in TypeScript and NodeJS (MERN stack primarily).
Expertise in memory management, security, event handling, distributed systems, and other core architectural concepts.
Significant experience designing, developing, and maintaining RESTful APIs.
Experience with AWS services such as EC2, S3, Lambda, and SQS.
Familiarity with CI/CD and DevOps practices.
Basic knowledge of AI systems and training models would be an added advantage.

Skills: code,aws (ec2, s3, lambda, sqs),ai systems,restful apis,devops,distributed systems,security,nodejs,ci/cd,event handling,typescript,memory management,mern stack

About the job
Role - Machine Learning Engineer 2 

Job Description 
 Telus International AI Data Solutions or TI AI for short, has been a global leader in data services since 2005. Listed on Feb 21 on the NYSE, TI now has a market cap of $10Million+. With Playment’s acquisition on July 21, we now have a combined strength in the video, images, and audio text labelling, serving the world’s top ML teams.
We’ve built a truly industry-agnostic platform to support the growing needs of our customers. Eg of our customer use cases - Automotive companies build self-driving capabilities, Agriculture companies for identify weeds & fruit picking, Insurance companies for claim processing & damage detection, Retail companies for shelf tracking, Drone/Satellite imagery for terrain analysis, E-commerce for cataloguing & visual object understanding etc.
Why is it important? 
 High-quality training data is quintessential to improving the precision of ML algorithms. Forbes lists ‘Autonomous Cars’ as one of the technology trends for the next decade and also estimates ML engineers spent 70% of their time in pre/post-processing & data management steps.

Companies need to build sophisticated tooling (supporting all forms of sensor data) and hire and manage hundreds of skilled people to ensure high-quality labelled data. Our autonomous driving customers estimate 1 hour of video data needs 800 man-hours of manual human work. Today, in the wake of the autonomous car industry only a few million km of data has been labelled, and 10x more will be collected before the world sees them on the road. Just as DevOps is critical to tech implementation, AI Ops will be a big challenge as AI development commercialises in the next 5-10 years. We aim to become an AI data platform, a critical part of the AI infrastructure stack.
 Join us to witness & influence the unfolding of AI, which is the largest technology wave the world will ever see.

About the job
This role is for one of the Weekday's clients

You’d be a fit if…

You have held Senior Software Engineer positions and bring 4-5 years of experience, with exceptional technical skills and a proven track record of successfully delivering complex engineering solutions.
You enjoy coding and leading by example, proactively making decisions and building solutions.
You are skilled at collaborating with product and growth teams to support dynamic product development and drive growth in early-stage SaaS companies.
You understand and empathize with customers, monitoring user sessions, grasping product and design aspects, and fully understanding the problem each feature is solving.

You should not apply if…

You haven’t spent at least three years working at one single company. Without this, you may not fully grasp the long-term impact of your decisions.
You can’t work hard. We are a self-funded company competing against billion-dollar VC-backed companies, and we work harder to succeed. If you can't commit to working 10-12 hours a day, six days a week, this may not be the right fit.
You lack attention to detail and quality. Our primary market is the US, and we pride ourselves on shipping high-quality software that works.
You are not product and customer-obsessed. If you only focus on the core technology without understanding the market and the customers’ needs, this role might not be suitable for you.

Looking For The Following Traits

Good to work with: Others enjoy collaborating with you because of your positive attitude and technical expertise.
Collaboration: You effectively work with engineers, product managers, and executives to clarify product requirements and maintain project visibility.
Varied Experience: You are comfortable working across a wide range of computational aspects, including distributed systems, networking, multiple programming languages, and large-scale systems.
Sprint Management: You can manage and drive sprints to deliver against the product roadmap.
Excellence: You are committed to striving for excellence in everything you do.
Customer Obsession: You prioritize customers’ needs and understand that the success of the product hinges on their success.
Hard Work: You are self-motivated, proactive, and dedicated, willing to work long hours as necessary.
Business and customer acumen: You understand the connection between the products we build and the revenue they generate, both directly and indirectly.

Responsibilities

Own Foundational Features: Lead and ship key features that directly impact customers, working independently and as part of the team to ensure reliable feature delivery.
Technical Leadership: Although this is not a managerial role, you will be the most experienced engineer, guiding the team, anticipating risks, and proactively solving challenges to ensure smooth product functionality.
Review and Debug Code: Participate in code reviews and help troubleshoot bugs. All engineers spend one day per week working on technical support to stay connected with customer challenges.
Improve Performance and Reliability: Continuously optimize legacy code to enhance system performance and reliability.

Requirements

At least 5 years of software engineering experience, ideally in an early-stage SaaS company.
Proven expertise in building and scaling complex systems for high-growth companies.
Strong proficiency in TypeScript and NodeJS (MERN stack primarily).
Expertise in memory management, security, event handling, distributed systems, and other core architectural concepts.
Significant experience designing, developing, and maintaining RESTful APIs.
Experience with AWS services such as EC2, S3, Lambda, and SQS.
Familiarity with CI/CD and DevOps practices.
Basic knowledge of AI systems and training models would be an added advantage.

Skills: code,aws (ec2, s3, lambda, sqs),ai systems,restful apis,devops,distributed systems,security,nodejs,ci/cd,event handling,typescript,memory management,mern stack

About the job
About Netskope

Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network and Data Security.

Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, St. Louis, Bangalore, London, Melbourne, Taipei, and Tokyo. Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events (pre and hopefully post-Covid) and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive. Visit us at Netskope Careers. Please follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter@Netskope.

Develop necessary tools, preferably in Python/Go, to assist with research, development & maintenance of app connectors. 
Work closely with the technical support team to handle customer escalations. Analyze the product gaps that resulted in customer issues and improve the signature resiliency and test strategy.
