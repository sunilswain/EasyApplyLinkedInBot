One of the remits of the group is the development of a suite of pre- and post-processors that work seamlessly with and around LS-DYNA. More details about the Product and Design group of Arup can be found on www.arup.com/dyna.

Overview of the Oasys LS-DYNA Environment Software: The Oasys LS-DYNA Environment includes a suite of software including Primer, D3PLOT, T/HIS, and Reporter. These are comprehensive LS-DYNA Pre and Post processing software used widely in the automotive, nuclear, and civil engineering community. The suite's primary use is testing vehicle crash worthiness for the automotive industry and object impact worthiness within our seismic, geotechnical, and building specialisms.

Overview of Role: We are seeking someone passionate about software development to join us in developing the Oasys suite. The position offers software development opportunities and interaction with end users, both internal and external to Arup.
The role involves working within small, friendly teams based in our Hyderabad and Bengaluru offices. The post holder will take responsibility for particular functions within the software, including some new functions that the post-holder will develop, as well as contributing to the general development effort (e.g. debugging, testing, and contributing to the design of new features).
Currently, new interfaces are being developed to enable the software to be used more broadly, an example of this is within computational fluid dynamics. The role also includes some customer support of the products with which the post holder is familiar. The role could entail specialism in the areas of testing and documentation. Work on software consultancy projects is also a possibility.
The post holder will liaise with other members of the software development team who are working on the same products. The post-holder will have regular contact with other members of the Product Design and Dyna Group in India and the UK.
The post-holder will also have contact with customers, for example answering support questions, and at meetings to understand customer needs.

Requirements:
• Good first degree in Engineering or Mathematics. Knowledge of FEM is desirable but not essential.
• Software development ability is essential. It is desirable that C and Fortran are known however training will be given from within the team if required.
• Display a logical approach to solving physical problems.
• Ability to see a problem from an end user’s perspective.
• Previous knowledge of LS-DYNA or other finite element / computer simulation software is desirable but not essential.

The role would suit an engineer who wishes to work in an engineering software development environment to develop software to solve physical problems.
